# Squares of Non-Negative Integers Challenge

## Task
The given code snippet reads an integer, \( n \), from the standard input. For all non-negative integers \( i \) less than \( n \), it prints \( i^2 \) on a separate line.

## Example

For \( n = 5 \), the list of non-negative integers less than \( n \) is \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\). The program prints the square of each number on a separate line:

```
0
1
4
9
16
```

## Input Format

The first and only line contains the integer \( n \).

## Constraints
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \)

## Output Format

Print \( n \) lines, each corresponding to the square of a non-negative integer less than \( n \).

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Sample Output
```
0
1
4
9
16
```
