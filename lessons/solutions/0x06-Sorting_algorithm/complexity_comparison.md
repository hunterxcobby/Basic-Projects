| Name                   | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Memory | Stable | Method Used         |
|------------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Quick Sort             | n log n   | n log n      | n^2        | log n  | No     | Partitioning, efficient for large datasets |
| Merge Sort             | n log n   | n log n      | n log n    | n      | Yes    | Merging, stable and consistent performance |
| Heap Sort              | n log n   | n log n      | n log n    | 1      | No     | Selection, in-place sorting with no recursion |
| Insertion Sort         | n         | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | Yes    | Insertion, simple and efficient for small datasets |
| Tim Sort               | n         | n log n      | n log n    | n      | Yes    | Insertion & Merging, hybrid sorting algorithm |
| Selection Sort         | n^2       | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | No     | Selection, simple but inefficient for large datasets |
| Shell Sort             | n log n   | n^(4/3)      | n^(3/2)    | 1      | No     | Insertion, gap-based variant of insertion sort |
| Bubble Sort            | n         | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | Yes    | Exchanging, simple but inefficient for large datasets |
| Tree Sort              | n log n   | n log n      | n log n    | n      | Yes    | Insertion, builds a binary search tree for sorting |
| Cycle Sort             | n^2       | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | No     | Selection, minimizes the number of memory writes |
| Strand Sort            | n         | n^2          | n^2        | n      | Yes    | Selection, simple and adaptive |
| Cocktail Shaker Sort   | n         | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | Yes    | Exchanging, bidirectional version of bubble sort |
| Comb Sort              | n log n   | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | No     | Exchanging, improves on bubble sort |
| Gnome Sort             | n         | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | Yes    | Exchanging, simple but less efficient |
| Oddâ€“even Sort          | n         | n^2          | n^2        | 1      | Yes    | Exchanging, parallelizable algorithm |
