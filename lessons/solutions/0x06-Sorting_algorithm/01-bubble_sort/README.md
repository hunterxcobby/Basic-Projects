**Bubble Sort:**

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a simplified explanation for a total beginner:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - Imagine you have a list of numbers.
   - The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list.

2. **Comparing and Swapping:**
   - It compares the first two numbers. If the first one is bigger than the second, they swap places.
   - It moves to the next pair and does the same thing.
   - This process continues, and after the first pass, the biggest number is guaranteed to be at the end of the list.

3. **Next Pass:**
   - Now, it repeats the process but ignores the last element (because it's already the biggest).
   - After the second pass, the second biggest number is in its place.

4. **Repeat Until Sorted:**
   - It keeps doing this, ignoring the last sorted element in each pass until the whole list is sorted.

**Example:**
Let's say you have this unsorted list: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5]`.

- First pass: `[2, 5, 1, 5, 9]` (swaps 5 and 2, then 9 and 1)
- Second pass: `[2, 1, 5, 5, 9]` (swaps 5 and 1)
- Third pass: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9]`

Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, but it's easy to understand and implement.
