### Chapter 4: Space Complexity

**Understanding Space Complexity**
- **Definition:** Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input.
- **Expressing Space Complexity:** Like time complexity, space complexity is expressed using Big O notation.

**Common Space Complexities:**
- **O(1):** Constant space complexity. The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory.
- **O(n):** Linear space complexity. Memory usage scales linearly with the input size.
- **O(n^2):** Quadratic space complexity. Memory usage scales with the square of the input size.
