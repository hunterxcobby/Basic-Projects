### Chapter 1: Introduction to Big O Notation

**What is Big O Notation?**
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It expresses how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the size of the input increases.

**Why is it Important?**
Understanding Big O helps us analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms. It provides a high-level perspective on how algorithms scale, allowing us to choose the most efficient solution for a given problem.
