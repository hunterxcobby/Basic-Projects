### Chapter 3: Evaluating Time Complexity

**Steps to Evaluate Time Complexity:**
1. **Identify Basic Operations:** Break down the algorithm into basic operations.
2. **Count Operations:** Count the number of basic operations performed.
3. **Express Complexity:** Use Big O notation to express how the count grows concerning the input size.

**Examples:**
- **Example 1:** For a loop that iterates through an array, the time complexity might be O(n) as it scales linearly with the array size.
- **Example 2:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) as it halves the search space with each iteration.
