### Chapter 9: Memory Complexity

**Introduction to Space Complexity:**
- **Space Complexity:** Analogous to time complexity but focuses on memory usage.
- **Calculating Space Complexity:** Understand how to analyze the memory requirements of an algorithm.

**Comparing Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Trade-offs:** Explore scenarios where minimizing time complexity might lead to increased space complexity, and vice versa.
