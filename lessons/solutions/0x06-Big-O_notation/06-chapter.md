### Chapter 6: Practical Examples

**Applying Big O to Real-World Problems:**
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Compare the time and space complexities of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Search Algorithms:** Analyze algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search.

Sorting Algorithms: Compare the time and space complexities of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Search Algorithms: Analyze algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search.
Using Analogies to Clarify Concepts:

Library Analogy: Consider a library where books represent data. Different sorting algorithms are like various methods of organizing the books on shelves.
