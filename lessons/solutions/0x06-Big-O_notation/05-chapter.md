### Chapter 5: Comparing Time and Space Complexities

**Balancing Time and Space:**
- **Optimization Trade-offs:** Algorithms often involve trade-offs between time and space complexity. Some may be optimized for minimal memory usage but take longer to execute, and vice versa.

**Illustrating with Diagrams:**
- Use diagrams to represent the growth of time and space complexities concerning the input size.
