### Chapter 2: Time Complexity

**Time Complexity Overview**
- **Definition:** Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input.
- **Expressing Time Complexity:** Big O notation is used to express time complexity. It focuses on the worst-case scenario, providing an upper bound on the runtime.

**Common Time Complexities:**
- **O(1):** Constant time complexity. The algorithm's runtime does not depend on the input size.
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic time complexity. Common in algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems.
- **O(n):** Linear time complexity. The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic time complexity. Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms.
- **O(n^2):** Quadratic time complexity. Common in algorithms with nested iterations.
