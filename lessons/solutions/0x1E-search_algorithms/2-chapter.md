Let's delve into the formal definitions as well.

1. **Auxiliary Space**:
   - Imagine you're moving houses. The auxiliary space is like the temporary storage space you might rent to store your belongings while you're transitioning between homes. It's the extra space your algorithm needs temporarily to perform its operations efficiently.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Now, think of your new apartment as the algorithm's workspace. The space complexity is like measuring the total area of your apartment, including both the space taken up by your furniture (auxiliary space) and the space you need to live in (space used by the input). In other words, space complexity considers all the space, temporary or otherwise, that your algorithm requires concerning the size of its input.

So, while auxiliary space is specifically the extra or temporary space, space complexity encompasses both the auxiliary space and the space used by the input to determine the overall space requirements of an algorithm.
