My apologies for the oversight. Here's the example code you provided and an explanation of its space complexity:

```C
int add(int n){
    if (n <= 0){
        return 0;
    }
    return n + add(n-1);
}
```

In this code, the function "add" recursively calls itself with a decremented value of "n" until "n" becomes less than or equal to 0, at which point it returns 0. Each recursive call adds a level to the call stack, and each level of recursion requires additional memory.

For example:
- When calling `add(4)`, it results in a chain of recursive calls like `add(3)`, `add(2)`, `add(1)`, and `add(0)`.
- Each call occupies space on the call stack until the base case is reached (`n <= 0`).

Since the depth of the recursion is directly proportional to the input size "n", the space complexity of this function is O(n). This is because the call stack grows linearly with the input size, requiring memory proportional to the input size to store the recursive function calls.
